Implement .Net Core backend service exposing HTTP REST API and implementing player's wallet.

**Functional requirements:**

• Player is identified by Guid identifier

• Player's wallet consists of balance (decimal value), currency is neglected, we expect everything 
to be in single common currency, e.g. EURO

• balance is manipulated via transactions (identified by unique Guid identifier, having transaction 
type and decimal money amount to add/subtract to the wallet balance)

• possible transaction types:

• deposit (increments balance)

• stake (decrements balance)

• win (increments balance)

• balance may never drop below 0 (transaction has to be rejected), in other case it is accepted

• each transaction should guarantee idempotent behavior (might be called several times with the 
same server state):

• if rejected initially => has to be rejected also on repeats

• if accepted initially => has to return accepted on repeats (however affecting balance just once)

• single player's transactions should be serializable (concurrent transactions of the same player 
should be processed in any order, but should keep player's wallet in a consistent state)

**Design APIs (contracts) for following operations:**

• register wallet for new player with initial balance 0 (should return error if player's wallet is 
already registered)

• get player's balance

• credit transaction to player's wallet (returns accepted/rejected)

• get list of saved transactions (id, amount, type) for given player

**Nonfunctional requirements:**

• service might be single node

• you don't need to implement data layer with real persistence, just define needed repository 
interfaces and provide its mocked in-memory implementations

**Bonus questions (just think how would you solve production grade implementation if):**

• you need to optimize for heavy reads (much more "get player's balance" API calls than "credit 
transaction" calls)

• you should support multi node deployment for distributing load
